## Machine learning on solid state chemistry

Application of machine learning techniques in solid state chemistry for clustering and predicting Perovskites

- employed PCA and unsupervised machine learning algorithms (kmeans, gaussian mixture model) to cluster 500+ Perovskite compounds and 120+ features
- built predictive models: neural networks, SVM, multinomial regression model with ridge, lasso, elastic nets 
- achieved an cross-validation accuracy rate 83% on average
