## Machine learning on solid state chemistry

Application of machine learning techniques in solid state chemistry for clustering and predicting Perovskites

- Employed PCA and other unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means, gaussian mixture model) to cluster 500+ Perovskites of 120+ features
- Built predictive models of neural networks, SVM, multinomial regression with ridge, lasso, elastic nets, gradient boosting machine
- Achieved an accuracy rate at 83% on average
